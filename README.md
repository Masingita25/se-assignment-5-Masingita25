                                                                                  2. Using the Keyboard Shortcuts UI:
                                                                                     - This opens the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.
                                                                                        - Search for the command you want to change.
                                                                                           - Click on the pencil icon next to the command to edit its keybinding.
                                                                                              - Press the desired key combination and press Enter to set the new keybinding.

                                                                                              3. Using the Keybindings JSON:
                                                                                                 - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`, and select it.
                                                                                                    - This opens the `keybindings.json` file where you can manually add or edit keybindings. For example, to change the keybinding for saving a file to `Ctrl+S`, you can add:
                                                                                                         ```json
                                                                                                              [
                                                                                                                     {
                                                                                                                              "key": "ctrl+s",
                                                                                                                                       "command": "workbench.action.files.save"
                                                                                                                                              }
                                                                                                                                                   ]
                                                                                                                                                        ```
9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Step-by-Step Guide to Debugging a Simple Program:

1. Open Your Project:
   - Open VS Code and open your project folder by selecting **File > Open Folder** or pressing `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`.

   2. Create a Sample Program:
      - Create a new file in your project, for example `app.js`, and add a simple JavaScript program:
           ```javascript
                // app.js
                     function greet(name) {
                            console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
                                 }

                                      greet('World');
                                           ```

                                           3. Open the Debug View:
                                              - Click the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open the Debug view.

                                              4. Configure the Debugger:
                                                 - Click the gear icon (⚙️) at the top of the Debug view or select Run > Add Configuration...from the menu. This will open the `launch.json` file.
                                                    - Choose the environment for your program. For a Node.js program, you might select `Node.js`.
                                                       - A default configuration will be added to the `launch.json` file. It might look like this:
                                                            ```json
                                                                 {
                                                                        "version": "0.2.0",
                                                                               "configurations": [
                                                                                        {
                                                                                                   "type": "node",
                                                                                                              "request": "launch",
                                                                                                                         "name": "Launch Program",

                                                                                                                                               "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
                                                                                                                                                        }
                                                                                                                                                               ]
                                                                                                                                                                    }
                                                                                                                                                                         ```

                                                                                                                                                                         5. Set Breakpoints:
                                                                                                                                                                            - Open your `app.js` file.
                                                                                                                                                                               - Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set breakpoints. For example, set a breakpoint on the `console.log` line:
                                                                                                                                                                                    ```javascript
                                                                                                                                                                                         console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Click here to set a breakpoint
                                                                                                                                                                                              ```

                                                                                                                                                                                              6. Start Debugging:
                                                                                                                                                                                                 - In the Debug view, select the configuration you created from the dropdown (if not already selected) and click the green play button (▶️) or press `F5` to start debugging.

                                                                                                                                                                                                 Key Debugging Features in VS Code:

                                                                                                                                                                                                 1. Breakpoints:
                                                                                                                                                                                                    - Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code.
                                                                                                                                                                                                       - Conditional breakpoints allow you to specify conditions under which the breakpoint should be hit.

                                                                                                                                                                                                       2. Step Through Code:
                                                                                                                                                                                                          - Step Over (`F10`): Execute the next line of code, but don't enter any functions.
                                                                                                                                                                                                             - Step Into (`F11`): Enter the function called at the current line.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Integrating Git with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows users to manage version control seamlessly within their development environment.
Initializing a Repository

1. Open Your Project in VS Code:
   - Open VS Code and navigate to your project folder by selecting File > Open Folder or pressing `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`.

2. Open the Source Control View:
   - Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`.

3. Initialize the Repository:
   - If your project folder is not already a Git repository, you'll see a message saying "No source control providers registered." Click the Initialize Repository button.
   - VS Code will run the `git init` command, creating a new Git repository in your project folder.

Making Commits

1. Stage Changes:
   - Changes to your files will appear in the Source Control view under the Changes section.
   - Hover over the file you want to stage, then click the + icon that appears next to the file name. Alternatively, click the + icon at the top of the Changes section to stage all changes.

2. Enter a Commit Message:
   - Once changes are staged, a text box will appear at the top of the Source Control view. Enter a meaningful commit message describing your changes.

3. Commit Changes:
   - Click the checkmark icon at the top of the Source Control view or press `Ctrl+Enter` to commit the staged changes.

Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Add a Remote Repository:
   - If you haven't already added a remote repository, open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then type and select `Git: Add Remote`.
   - Enter a name for the remote (usually `origin`) and the URL of your GitHub repository. The URL can be found on your repository page on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`).

2. Push Changes:
   - After adding a remote, you can push your commits to GitHub. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type and select `Git: Push`, or click the ellipsis icon (...) in the Source Control view and select Push.
   - If it's the first time pushing to a new remote branch, you might need to specify the upstream branch. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal (open with `Ctrl+`):
     ```sh
     git push -u origin main
     ```
   - Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it’s different.

Key Git Features in VS Code

1. Branches:
   - Create and switch branches easily using the branch icon in the Source Control view or by using the Command Palette (`Git: Create Branch` or `Git: Checkout to...`).

2. Merge Conflicts:
   - VS Code provides a user-friendly interface for resolving merge conflicts, showing changes side by side and offering actions to accept or discard changes.

3. History and Diffs:
   - View commit history and file changes by right-clicking on a file and selecting **Git: View File History** or **Git: View Line History**. Use the Source Control view to see diffs for individual files.

4. Git Commands:
   - Execute any Git command directly from the terminal within VS Code, giving you full control over your version control operations.

5. Extensions:
   - Enhance your Git workflow with extensions like **GitLens** for detailed insights into code changes and authorship.

Example Workflow:

1. Initialize the Repository:
   - Open your project folder in VS Code.
   - Open the Source Control view and click Initialize Repository.

2. Make Changes and Commit:
   - Edit some files in your project.
   - Stage the changes and enter a commit message.
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit.

3. Push to GitHub:
   - Open the Command Palette and run `Git: Add Remote` to add your GitHub repository.
   - Push your commits to GitHub by running `Git: Push` from the Command Palette or Source Control view
